## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Today I'm going to verify the BQ access changes in GCloud console that were made in the infra access repo.
Once verified, I can start looking into pushing data to BigQuery using the data pipeline tool.
Insaf has asked to be onboarded to the project this afternoon so I can walk her through the current state of the project and what needs to be done next.
I'll need to add him and Vikky to the BigQuery access variables in the infra access repo as well.
I should ask the team about the process for creating a feature flag for this project to use with the frontend work.

- Verified the BQ access changes in GCloud console that were made in the infra access repo.
- Created dev_jt dataset in BigQuery.
- Opened a PR to add the rest of the xseries team to the the infra access repo BigQuery access variables.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I'm going to push this to next week since I have a lot on my plate with the Cash Movement Report right now.

## Miscellaneous

There's a developer survey going around that I need to fill out.
