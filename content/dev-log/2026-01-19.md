## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Updated PR LRX-32372 to address feedback from Dania and re-requested a review.

### Line Item Consolidation

Picked up priority ticket LRX-31574 Setting to disable line item consolidation from Samy which needs to be done by EoW.
After investigation, determined 5 changes will be needed:

- Add setting to UI in the frontend service
- Add EnableLineItemConsolidation to the GraphQL service UpdateRetailerSettings mutation
- Add enable_line_item_consolidation to the monolith via the internal retailer settings endpoint and the retailer API endpoint
- Update UpdateRetailerSettings in the settings service?
- Handle workflows default behavior with migration
- change line item splitting check in the register service to use new setting
