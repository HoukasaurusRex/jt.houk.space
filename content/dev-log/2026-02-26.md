## Incidents

### #260226-3299 — Reporting Consumer Lag (SEV-3)

The incident began with reports of the reporting consumers experiencing a steady increase in lag, impacting X-Series Reporting. I took on the role of Incident Manager and led triage. The team considered restarting the reporting-consumer service, which had resolved a previous occurrence, but this alone did not fully clear the issue. A prior incident of the same type had been traced to a poorly performing SQL query; however, no clear root cause was identified this time. After redeploying the `the reporting consumer (production)` service, consumer lag dropped and the issue was resolved. The incident was accepted as Sev-3, the summary was updated, and the reporting team was tagged to investigate the recurring nature of this lag pattern. The incident was then closed, and a post-incident review was opened.

### Key Points

- Reporting consumers showed a steady increase in lag, affecting X-Series Reporting
- Root cause was not definitively identified; incident had recurred at least twice previously
- A prior similar incident was caused by a poorly performing SQL query — not confirmed as the cause this time
- Service restart was attempted first but did not fully resolve the issue
- Redeploying `the reporting consumer (production)` resolved the lag
- Incident accepted as Sev-3; reporting team tagged for follow-up

### Next Steps

- Complete post-incident review: document timeline, set timestamps, export review, schedule debrief, and get director sign-off
- Tag the reporting team to investigate the recurring consumer lag and identify the root cause
- Review alerting coverage for consumer lag trends to improve early detection
- Evaluate whether the previously identified slow SQL query pattern has re-emerged or a new cause is present
