## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

I'm looking for work that still needs to be done.
I've updated the epic in Jira with the current ticket statuses.
I'm going to take on the newly created issue for the weird time_zone bug we found yesterday.
If I have time I can try running some performance tests on search index queries as well.

#### LRX-31979 Invalid time zone issue

- Reproduce issue in dev environment by loading poopy data.
- Debug root cause of issue.
- Implement fix and test.

## Learning

### French

If there's time I'd like to make some progress on my French lessons today.

### Individual Development Plan

I should fill out the IDP form for my goals of achieving staff engineer and improving my leadership skills.
