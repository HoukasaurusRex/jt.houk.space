## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Going to update my branch LRX-32638/sort-sales-by-invoice-number in the search indexing service with the feedback from my code review and then merge.
I need to update the index mapping for invoice_number by running a task.
Reviewed Zhijie's work on LRX-31795-add-registers-filter.
I need to review LRX-32357 Add new sales filters as well.

## External requests

Reviewing LRX-35064 Handle invalid customer address in auto-tax calculations
Got another request to review LRX-34546 fix: Address quote rounding issue

## Ideas

### Transifex standardization

There are some technical documents regarding transifex that focus on the technical details of how to use transifex but don't give a good overview of the overall process and best practices for using it.
I think it would be helpful to have a more standardized onboarding document for transifex that includes an overview of the process, best practices, and common pitfalls to avoid.
I also want to find places to fix broken links and consolidate information to make it easier to find and understand.
See: the Localization Guidelines (internal wiki) and the internal developer handbook (internationalization section)

### Search indexing service documentation improvements

Using the console tool instead of the old console to run tasks — see the Elasticsearch Mappings update guide (internal wiki)
