# Dropbox Paper CMS

[![Dropbox Paper CMS NPM](/dropbox-paper-cms.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dropbox-paper-cms)

Wanna know how to publish content to your site using Dropbox Paper? Here's a node module for that. It's a small script to asynchronously fetch content from your Dropbox Paper account and write all of those beautiful documents you have stowed away to be released unto the world on your server. Complete with a sidebar config update for vuepress, it's a nifty little thing I had fun making and use on all of my vuepress sites [including this one](https://github.com/Pterobyte/houkasaurus).

It's built in Node with a little bonus experimentation with [Node ES Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_ecmascript_modules) and showing off as many badges as I could find.
