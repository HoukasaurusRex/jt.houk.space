Akkadu is a live stream interpretation platform where streamers can match with simultaneous interpreters and stream their content directly through the site. It was build from the ground up as a streaming service first using [SocketIO](https://socket.io/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and the open source [Opus Codec](https://www.opus-codec.org/) as a simple 3-way communication tool between streamers, interpreters, and a live audience. It quickly grew to a live event management tool complete with presentation and interpreter management and a mobile PWA.

Akkadu was a product of love and sweat from a team of 3 engineers over almost a year of development before it grew to be an international project spanning dozens of languages.
