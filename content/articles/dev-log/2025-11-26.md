### Sales History Improvements

After spending hours trying to get the Sales History page to load data in my local environment,
I ended up nuking my environment and posting my issue to the platform engineering channel.
Today I plan on using the smoke testing repo Sergii sent me to populate sales data and get my store back up and running.
