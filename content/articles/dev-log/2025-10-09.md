### Cash Movement Report

There are some errors in the cash movement deployment that I need to investigate.
The errors don't seem to match with the deployed schema changes, so I'm not sure what's causing them.
Hamish also wants me to help with a cost analysis for the search index so I'm going to check out the table size in production.
If I can't figure out this issue today, I will need to pass it off to Insaf to investigate further.
