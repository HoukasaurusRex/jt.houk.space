## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Merged LRX-32370: Add Name To Paymenttype
Merged LRX-32372: Update Customer Documents Handler - [typey:591](https://github.com/vend/typey/pull/591)
- Monitored for any issues post-deployment, none reported so far.
- Noticed an issue with deployment rollout and started investigating.
- Reverted the deployment to the previous stable version to ensure system stability while investigating the issue.

### Line Item Consolidation

Added two new tickets for running a migration to set default values for existing retailers and updating webregister to respect the new setting.
