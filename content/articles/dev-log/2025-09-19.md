## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

I need to follow up with the platform team to verify the process for updating the BigQuery access variables.
The roadmap also should be updated with the new order of tickets.
If I have time I can get started looking into sql2bq today to see how it works.

- Sent a message to the platform team and Rustam since he's last updated this area to verify the process for updating the BigQuery access variables and review my work.
- Updated the roadmap with the new order of tickets. Projected to finish by the 6th of November (including vacation days).

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I didn't get a chance to look into the endpoints involved in the catalog sync on register bootup yesterday,
so I'll try to get to that today while I'm waiting for a review on my work in gaia-basecamp.

## Code Reviews

Dania has a PR open for enabling line item splitting in training mode in the register I still need to review.

- Reviewed and approved Dania's PR for enabling line item splitting in training mode in the register.
