## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

The performance improvements are working well but there are some failing tests I need to investigate.
I want to get Roberto's test store to enlist him to test the report in prod as well.

- I've identified and fixed the issues causing the failing tests and pushed the performance improvements to production.

## Ideas

I think using an AI agent to analyze failing tests in CI and publish a summary of the issues and potential fixes could be really useful.
This could help speed up debugging and reduce the time spent on triaging test failures.
I'll need to research existing tools and frameworks for building AI agents and see how they can be integrated into our CI pipeline.
