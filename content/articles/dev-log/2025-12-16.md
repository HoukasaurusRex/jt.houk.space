## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Working on refactoring the sales total filter according to feedback from Dania today.

## Life

### Sleep

Last night I was up until about 2am trying to sleep.
I'm not sure why this is happening lately,
I've been exercising, getting some sunlight, and avoiding screens before bed.
Hopefully I can get back to a normal sleep schedule soon.

### Trips

We booked our flights for our trip to see family in Korea next Jan-Feb - cost about $2,300 each round trip.
We're gonna be able to see Travis and Carlin on the way though in Vancouver which will be nice.
We're also looking forward to Woojoo's wedding!
Next we're gonna look into accommodation options and where we want to travel after the wedding.
