## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Thomas has sent me some feedback and resources to optimize the datatables in BigQuery,
so I'm going to research and implement partitioning and clustering to improve performance and reduce costs.
Rado has sent me a query to get integrator data for register_closure events I'm going to check out to get back to Samy and Laurence with.

- Updated CDC stream clustering for cash_movement table and register_open_sequence table with new clustering strategy.
- Set up local testing to verify config changes.

## Reviews

- Reviewed Vicky's updated PR in monocle for the cash movement report skeleton and provided additional feedback.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I'll try to get to this after I finish the foundational work for the Cash Movement Report.

## Training

### French

I'm gonna try to do 30 minutes of the Lightspeed French course today.

### Security

- Completed the Security Awareness Training module on phishing and social engineering.

## Team

I've got a performance review for Samy I should complete today.

- Completed Samy's performance review and submitted it for HR processing.
- Nominated Samy for Make It Awards.
