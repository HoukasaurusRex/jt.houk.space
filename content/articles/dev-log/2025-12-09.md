## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Rolled out to 75% of customers today as planned.
No issues reported so far and endpoint performance remains stable.
Planning to go to 100% rollout tomorrow if everything continues to look good.

### Sales History Improvements

Product filter changes put the bundle size over the limit (0.65kb).
I analyzed the bundle report and identified a large dependencies that could be lazy loaded, upgraded, or replaced with smaller alternatives,
then brought these findings to the frontend platform team for further discussion on how to proceed.
They decided to go forward with upgrading the react-datepicker library while I increase the threshold temporarily to unblock the release.
I'm also interested in eploring lazy loading the edit customer modal at the end of this project for ~100kb savings.

Otherwise, I've completed my work on LRX-31798 (add time range filter) and submitted a PR for review,
including some additional regression tests around the date filter component to prevent future issues.
