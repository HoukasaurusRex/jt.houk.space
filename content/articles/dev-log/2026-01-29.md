## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Debugging issue with local typey domain consumer when LRX_30921_sales_history_typey_consumer is enabled.

## Incidents

### 260129-3208-sev-2-sales-not-appearing-in-sales-history

Investigated issue where sales were not appearing in sales history for a retailer.
Discovered that the typey domain consumer was failing to process sales after enabling LRX_30921_sales_history_typey_consumer feature flag for my demo account.
Did not prevent sales from being created, but they were not being indexed into sales history from retailers in the same partition.
Rolled back the feature flag to restore sales history functionality while I debug the issue further.
Created a hotfix to address the problem and will redeploy the feature flag once verified.
