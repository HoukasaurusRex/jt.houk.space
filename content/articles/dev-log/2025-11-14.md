### Cash Movement Report

I've discovered 2 issues after deploying the cash movement report frontend yesterday.

- Amount column should display net values, not absolute values.
  - This issue comes from a discrepancy between dev and prod data.
    Dev data uses positive amounts for cash movements while prod data uses negative amounts for outflows.
- Sorting by any column returns a 500 error from the API.
  - This issue comes from discrepancies between the frontend sort parameters and the backend sort parameters.
