## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

I've got 4 tickets to take on today:

- Finish and merge Vikki's task on actions integration for the cash movement report.
- Verify export menu has been completed.
- Update the report query to use the dimension property instead of the cashMovementTableFormat property in monocle.
- Swap out the mock data for API calls with real data from production datasets.
