## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Spent 3 hours today debugging a new issue with nobob resulting in no data showing up in my local sales history page.
Ended up finding the solution by asking for suggestions from the team and finally trying `task consumer:down` and `task consumer:up`.

After getting data to load, I was able to finish the product filter changes and submit for review.
