## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Starting work on LRX-32638 [BE] Sort sales by invoice number in typey.
Reviewing LRX-32363 Add sale total to SaleDocument and LRX-31794: Add payment type filter UI to sales history and LRX-32368: [BE] Update user-documents handler in typey.

## Team

I completed my self evaluation for this cycle and shared it with Samy.

### Headline

Senior full-stack developer delivering and maintaining analytics and reporting features for the Selling Experience team, with expanded ownership of Cash Movement Report and cross-team coordination.


### Evaluation against the Career GPS

#### Scope: At level

Owns end-to-end delivery of complex features across full stack (frontend web UI, backend APIs, data pipelines, BigQuery infrastructure). Coordinates with multiple stakeholders including Platform, Insights, SRE, and Localization teams. Since joining in July 2025, scope has expanded to include ownership of Cash Movement Report (16k requests/month, p95 5s latency) and leadership of Line Item Consolidation project. Manages complexity across 5+ repositories and services.

#### Impact: At level

Exhibits behaviors aligned with Guiding Principles through proactive engagement, asking clarifying questions in meetings to surface ambiguity, and adapting well to feedback. Demonstrates learning agility by quickly ramping up on BigQuery infrastructure despite minimal prior experience. Shows potential for increased impact through cross-team collaboration improvements (documentation contributions to Merchant Insights, responsiveness to Localization team requests). Actively invests in professional development through mentoring junior team members and sharing technical knowledge.

#### Skills

**Coding: At level**

Delivers production-quality code across full stack with strong attention to detail. Demonstrated expertise in performance optimization (12x query speed improvement: 9s → 752ms), complex data handling (UUID binary conversion), and component architecture (TimeRangeFilter refactoring). Uses AI tools (Copilot, Claude) effectively to accelerate delivery and maintain code consistency. Regular contributor to code quality through thorough reviews across team and cross-team PRs.

**Operational Excellence: Exceeds level**

Managed phased rollout of Cash Movement Report (25% → 75% → 100%) with zero critical incidents. Proactively monitors production systems, catching and resolving issues before customer impact (Jan 21 deployment revert, Jan 29 incident response). Established BigQuery access and development environments for team members. Demonstrates systematic debugging across distributed systems (GraphQL, BigQuery, GCP, Datadog). Created feature flags and managed environment configurations effectively.

**Quality Mindset: At level**

Proactively identifies data integrity issues (foreign key constraints, orphaned records) and adds preventative measures (regression tests for date filters). Discovers gaps in API documentation and creates tickets for resolution. Validates data flow and catches quality issues ("poopy data") before production impact. Balances pragmatic delivery with technical rigor, though requirements validation processes could be strengthened (time range filter misunderstanding required refactor).

**System Design: At level**

Designed and implemented end-to-end data pipeline from local databases to BigQuery using CDC streams and sql2bq. Demonstrated strong optimization skills through partitioning strategies (retailer hash), query optimization (aggregate-optimized paths), and performance profiling. Successfully navigated complex microservices architecture across multiple repositories. Room for growth in architectural influence and early performance baseline establishment.

**Continuous Improvement: At level**

Documents lessons learned throughout projects for team benefit. Identifies process friction points in project retrospective (messy handoffs, stakeholder coordination). Takes action on improvement opportunities (documented requirements validation checklist after time range filter incident). Analyzes cloud costs and provides data-driven optimization recommendations. Actively seeks to improve cross-team relations through better documentation and responsive collaboration.

**Innovation: At level**

Proposed two strategic AI automation initiatives aligned with company direction: AI-powered documentation generation from code artifacts, and AI agent for CI test analysis to speed debugging. Applied creative problem-solving to technical challenges (UUID binary handling, performance optimization). Demonstrates forward-thinking approach to tooling and process improvements, though proposals have not yet been adopted or implemented.

**AI Proficiency: At level**

Effectively integrates AI tools into daily workflow using Copilot for code generation and refactoring, and Claude for implementation planning and edge case analysis. Uses AI to accelerate delivery while maintaining code quality and consistency. Demonstrates pragmatic application of AI to solve concrete problems rather than experimentation for its own sake.


### Why not a lower rating?

JT consistently delivers solid results that meet or exceed expectations for a Senior Software Developer. The Cash Movement Report project demonstrates technical excellence with measurable business impact (16k requests/month, industry-leading p95 5s latency, 12x performance improvement). Zero critical incidents during major production rollouts reflects strong operational discipline. Proactive quality focus and cross-team collaboration show behaviors aligned with company values. Regular mentorship of junior developers (Insaf, Vicky) and contribution to team code quality through reviews demonstrate positive team impact beyond individual contributions.


### Why not a higher rating?

To achieve a higher rating, JT should focus on:

**Expanding architectural influence**: Drive technical direction across multiple teams and systems, not just within owned features. Participate more actively in architectural discussions and RFC processes.

**Increasing cross-company visibility**: Share technical expertise more broadly through tech talks, documentation contributions, or leading working groups. Make optimization methodologies and best practices accessible to other teams.

**Strengthening stakeholder management**: Improve requirements gathering and validation processes to reduce implementation rework. Build stronger relationships with product and design partners earlier in project lifecycle.

**Mentorship formalization**: Develop structured approach to mentoring junior developers with measurable growth outcomes. Document and share mentorship practices with team.

**Innovation execution**: Move beyond proposing ideas to driving adoption and implementation of process improvements and automation initiatives.
