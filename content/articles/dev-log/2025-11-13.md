## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

I've spent all my time yesterday on that time zone bug, so today I want to get back to making progress on the cash movement report.
This morning I will deploy the fix for the time zone bug and test it in production.
After that I intend to test the performance of notes search and see if the index is necessary.

- Deploy and monitor time zone bug fix.
- Deploy cash movement frontend
