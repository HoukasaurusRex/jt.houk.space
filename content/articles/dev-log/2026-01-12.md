## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Pushed the changes to fix currency and pluralization localization issues today, now waiting on review.
Started reviewing Leo's work on LRX-32367: Create a new consumer in typey while he's out on vacation to see if it's ready to merge
before continuing my related work on LRX-32372: Update customer documents handler to use the new consumer.
