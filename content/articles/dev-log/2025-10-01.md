## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Today I should be able to finalize the cash movement cdc stream and open it for review.
After our discussion yesterday, I should investigate webhooks to see how much work it would be to add cash movement data to the register_closure event.

- Finalized the configuration for the cash movement cdc stream and opened a PR for review.
- Investigated the register_closure webhook and located the relevant repositories involved.

## Reviews

- Reviewed Vicky's PR in monocle for the cash movement report skeleton and provided feedback.
- Reviewed Dania's PR in webregister for adding the internal bizrulez endpoint for getting remote business rules and provided feedback.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I'll try to get to this after I finish the foundational work for the Cash Movement Report.

## Learning

### French

I've just been enrolled in the Lightspeed French course which starts this week. I should start with 2 hours this week.
