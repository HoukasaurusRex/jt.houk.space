## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Finished setting up the testing environment for LRX-32372: Update customer documents handler to use the new consumer in typey.
Used the http://localhost:9203/vend-register_sale-3.1/_search endpoint to validate that customer names are being indexed correctly now.
Recorded a demo video of the changes to share with Dania and Leo to review.

Reviewing Dania's PR LRX-33477 Add timezone search filter to sales search query.
