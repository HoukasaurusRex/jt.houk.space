## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Completed review for LRX-32368: [BE] Update user-documents handler in typey.
Reviewing LRX-32363 Add sale total to SaleDocument and LRX-31794: Add payment type filter UI to sales history
For my work with LRX-32638 [BE] Sort sales by invoice number in typey,
I've found an existing index on invoice_number but no tests for it,
so I'm writing functional and integration tests and manually testing the search endpoints.
Reviewed Fix line item consolidation inventory warning work from Dania.
Note: it's taking me all morning to run task daily. The containers keep timing out on docker pull.
