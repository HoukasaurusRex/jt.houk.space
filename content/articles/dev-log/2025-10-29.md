## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Today I'm focusing on getting the cash movement report unblocked.
Vikki has been out, so I'm taking over her tasks and reviewing Kapil's work on the report.
I'll run some performance tests on the search index and analyze the table size in prod for cost implications.
Insaf has taken over the issues at the CDC streams which I'll summarize here.

- retailer_id needed to be defined as a hydrated field on register_open_sequence_v1 https://github.com/vend/reporting-reservoir/pull/527/files
- cash_movement table type field needed to be changed from tinyint to tinyint(4) to not be interpreted as a boolean
- the streams in reporting reservoir needed to be updated and backfilled https://github.com/vend/reporting-reservoir/pull/533/files
- null retailer_id values needed to be filtered in the backfill https://github.com/vend/reporting-reservoir/pull/534

#### Work Done

- Created a new task to address issue with using cashMovementTableFormat property on the report query instead of dimension in monocle.
- Took over Vikki's tasks and will merge them tomorrow morning. Export should be already integrated.
