## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

Yesterday I completed the UI text changes and passed review.
This ticket will need to wait until after the Black Fridya code freeze to be deployed.
In the meantime, we will create a branch to merge these changes into for a simple deployment after the freeze.
Today, I will work on finishing the product filter UI changes.

### Cash Movement Report

If I have some time, I'll add some work towards updating the report onboarding docs from what I've learned.

## Learning

Tomorrow I have a meeting with Mystine so I need to finish my unit 2 french and prepare topics.
