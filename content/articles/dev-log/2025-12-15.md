## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Zhijie handled the release to VIP customers last Friday while I was out.
Noticed one customer with a slow (42s) query time in the Cash Movement Report logs today.
Analyzed their query in GCP and found they have many orphaned records - cash movements without register open sequences (maybe deleted?)

### Sales History Improvements

After discussing with Zhijie and Dania, created a megabranch to merge our changes into while code freeze is in effect.
Struggled with some issues in CI, looks like many people have been hitting similar problems recently.
