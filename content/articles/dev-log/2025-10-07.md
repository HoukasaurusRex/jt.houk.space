## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

The PR for the cash movement cdc stream is still under review. I'll follow up with the Insights team to see if they have any questions or need any changes before we can merge it.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

Stephen told me I can find the "Offline mode" UBEs in BigQuery, so today I'll try to locate them and see what data is being logged.

- Located the "Offline mode" UBEs in BigQuery, wrote queries to collect the relevant data, and started analyzing the results.
  It seems the UBEs for the Register Syn event are only emitted for the register service, so I will need a new strategy to collect ipad data.
- I dug into datadog and started looking at the endpoint calls - I cross referenced this with an export of the aws cost explorer data by service,
  and I've got a good estimate now for the total cost of offline mode for the register service. I will need to do more digging to get the ipad data.
- While looking into this, I found a huge spike in OpenSearch costs over a few days this year that account for over 30% of the total costs.
  I will need to investigate this further to understand what caused the spike and if there are any optimizations we can make to reduce costs.
