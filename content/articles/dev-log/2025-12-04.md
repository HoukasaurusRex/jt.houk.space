## Projects

### Sales History Improvements

The product filter change is approved and ready to be merged after platform team reviews it for the code thaw starting today.
I'm going to run some last minute tests to make sure everything is working as expected before the merge.

### Cash Movement Report

We need to investigate the feasibility of releasing a patch to fix the end date bug found during the bug bash before the code freeze ends.
Kapil was able to find and fix the date input component, but there's still the csv title issue that needs to be addressed.
I'll talk with Samy and Andrew to see if we can release this patch quickly or if it needs to wait until after the freeze.
