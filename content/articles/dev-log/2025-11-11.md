## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

I'm continuing to work on finalizing the cash movement report for production release.

- Reviewing Zhijie's work on connecting frontend to API.
- Investigating BigQuery bug that surfaced due to poopy data in prod

#### Project Review

- Release issues
  - Issues with CDC streams (cash movement type boolean change)
  - Issues with UI data connections
- Missed considerations
  - Webhooks? Brought up in middle of project and not addressed
- Project roadblocks
  - Handing off work messy
  - Friction with knowledge holders
  - Meetings without project members
