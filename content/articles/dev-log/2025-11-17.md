### Cash Movement Report

I fixed the 2 issues I found on Friday with the cash movement report.
Today I'm preparing the rollout for tomorrow morning.
I'll need to enable the feature flag for lightspeedcafe and laurslollie today for testing before the full rollout tomorrow.
There is also some performance testing needed for the notes search index.
