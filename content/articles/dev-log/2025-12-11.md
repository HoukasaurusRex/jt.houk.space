## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Monitored the Cash Movement Report after completing the rollout to 100% of customers yesterday.
No issues have been reported and endpoint performance has remained stable.
Releasing to ICP customers today as planned.

### Sales History Improvements

Finishing up the Sales History time range filter feature today.
Addressed feedback from the team after demoing the feature yesterday,
including some UI adjustments to improve usability and accessibility.
Also added additional unit and integration tests to cover edge cases identified during testing.
Preparing to submit a PR for review later today once final testing is complete.

## Retro

### What Went Well

**Successful phased rollout strategy**: Cash Movement Report deployed incrementally (25% → 75% → 100%) with zero issues and stable performance throughout. This approach validated our risk mitigation strategy and gave us confidence in future releases.

**Bug bash effectiveness**: Company-wide bug bash surfaced critical issues before customer impact, including end date handling bug in Cash Movement Report UI. Found 2 additional bugs in sales flow, demonstrating value of dedicated testing time.

### What Didn't Go Well

**Requirements misalignment on time range filter**: Misinterpreted requirements despite asking for clarification in discovery and mentioning in standups. Issue only surfaced during demo, requiring refactoring from integrated time field to separate TimeRangeFilter component. Lost ~1 day of work.

**Recurring environment issues with nobob**: Hit setup problems twice in two weeks (3 hours debugging on 11/27, environment nuke required on 12/10). Indicates documentation gaps or tooling fragility affecting team productivity.

### Action Items

**Improve requirements validation process**: When unclear on requirements, request visual mockups or written examples before implementation. Follow up proactively if clarification questions aren't addressed in meetings or standups.
