## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Monitored the rollout of the Cash Movement Report updates to customers today.
Endpoint performance looks good so far with no reported issues.
Increased rollout to 25% of customers with plans to go to 75% tomorrow if all goes well.
I also need to add my documentation updates to the Selling pod sprint review slides for tomorrow.

### Sales History Improvements

There are now conflicts with the main branch I need to resolve today due to other changes merged during code freeze.
I've picked up LRX-31798 (add time range filter) to work on next after resolving the conflicts.
