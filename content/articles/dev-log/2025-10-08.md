## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

The PR for the cash movement cdc stream has been approved. Today I will merge it and deploy the changes to production,
and monitor the data flow to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
I need access to the production datasets in order to add the search index on the new cash movement report table,
so I'll reach out to the Insights team to get that access.
I'll also see if we want to continue with adding cash movement data to the register_closure webhook event.

- Merged the PR for the cash movement cdc stream and deployed the changes to production.
- Monitored the data flow and confirmed that the cash movement data is being captured correctly.
- Reached out to the Insights team to request access to the production datasets for adding the search index.
- Discovered access limitations to developer tables in sbx and discussed with the Insights team to find a solution.
  We're considering using the production datasets for frontend development, while I sent Z a seed file with instructions to set up a local dev environment.
- Met with Z, Vicky, and Wasiff to discuss project priorities and next steps for the cash movement report and other tasks.
