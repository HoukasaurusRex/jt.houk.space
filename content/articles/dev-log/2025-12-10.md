## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Successfully rolled out the Cash Movement Report updates to 100% of customers today.
No issues have been reported and endpoint performance has remained stable throughout the rollout.

### Sales History Improvements

Wrestled a bit with the new nobob setup today which took about an hour to get everything working correctly,
but I had to nuke my environment and start fresh to get past some strange errors.

After demoing the time range filter feature to the team and gathering feedback,
I was made aware of my misinterpretation of the requirements regarding the date field.
I had asked about using the time field in the existing date filter component, but it turns out the intention was to have a separate time range filter component.
I went ahead and refactored the implementation to create a new TimeRangeFilter component that works alongside the existing DateRangeFilter.
This new component allows users to select specific time ranges independently of the date selection.
I updated the relevant tests to reflect this change as well.
It is important to note that this issue was only brought up after showing the demo,
and was not caught during the discovery meeting where I had initially asked for clarification,
or on each of the two days I had mentioned it during standup.
