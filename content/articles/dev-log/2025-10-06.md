## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

I'm waiting on approval from the Insights team to merge the new CDC stream configurations for cash_movement and register_open_sequence tables.
Once approved, I'll proceed with deploying the changes to production and monitor the data flow to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I plan to start investigating the offline mode costs this week.

- Compiled a list of endpoints involved in offline mode data sync and their triggers.
