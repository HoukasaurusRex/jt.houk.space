## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Thomas from Insights reviewed my PR and left some comments I need to address.
In the meantime I can start looking into sql2bq to see how it works.
I also need answers on how to roll out the feature flags.

- Addressed Thomas's comments on my PR and made the requested changes.
- Added testing data to local db to prepare for uploading to BigQuery.
- Started looking into sql2bq to see how it works.
- Installed the google-cloud-sdk to be able to use the bq command line tool and authenticated using `gcloud auth application-default login`
- Opened a PR in sql2bq to add cash movement table and register open sequence table.
- Cl√©ment from NZ SRE helped with merging my PR in gaia-basecamp using signed commits.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I'll try to get to looking into the endpoints involved in the catalog sync on register bootup some time this week while waiting on reviews.
