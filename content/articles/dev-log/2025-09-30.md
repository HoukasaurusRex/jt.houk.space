## Projects

### Cash Movement Report

Very close to uploading test data to BigQuery using sql2bq, just having an issue with cli tool errors joining users table.
  I need to figure out where the users table is located since it's not in the same db as cash_movement.

- After learning that some id fields are varchar(16) because they are uuids converted to binary(16) for space efficiency,
  I was able to adjust my sql2bq scripts to accommodate this and successfully upload test data to BigQuery.
- Validated the data in BigQuery and it looks good, just need to get Thomas to review my new approach.
- Added search index on notes field in cash_movement table to improve query performance.
- Opened a draft PR on adding both cash movement and register open sequence streams to the reporting-reservoir, putting myself ahead of schedule.
- In the thread with Mat Hansen, it seems the integrator Project 96 actually needs cash movement data in the register_closure event webhooks, not a public api.
  We should consider if we want to add this to our current sprint.

## Investigations

### Offline Mode Costs

I'll try to get to this after I finish the foundational work for the Cash Movement Report.
